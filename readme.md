# Extra time - Lucas Berghoef - 500771170

For the extra time of this course I had to first catch up on my javascript skills by using CodeAcademy. I also read the book D3.js in action by Elijah Meeks before the course started 

Because I am originally from CMD on the Avans Hogeschool in Den Bosch, I had some catching up to do with my Javascript skills. I did this in the summer recess by using Code Academy. I also got the advice to read the book "D3.js in Action" by Elijah Meeks before the course started so I would be more able to go along with the course. So I did both of those things in summer recess to be ready for the class, this must have already taken more than 20 hours, probably more like 40 hours during the summer holiday.

Upon starting the course I also read the Hitchhiker's Guide to D3.js on medium (https://medium.com/@enjalot/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-d3-js-a8552174733a) just to get some fresh information after not having done anything with D3 in the first weeks of school.

For the last assignment I had to find out more about TopoJson maps. I used http://mapstarter.com to get topoJson file to work for me.
